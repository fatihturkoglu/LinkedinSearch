These codes are used to find professional profiles that meet specific criteria on LinkedIn. For example, by using keywords such as "CEO" and "Location," you can search for profiles of individuals in a particular position or in a specific location. The codes direct your search to specific pages on LinkedIn (such as individual profiles or public resumes) and filter out unwanted results (such as job postings or group pages). Additionally, you can customize the search by adding a filter like "email:@gmail.com" to target users with specific email domains, such as @yahoo.com or @outlook.com.

By using different LinkedIn domain names for each country, the search is tailored to users in that country. This is an effective way to expand your professional network and find potential business partners or employees.

The usage is straightforward; simply copy the code for the desired country and paste it into the Google search engine. You can also specify the city in the "Location" section. For example, for Berlin in Germany, you can use the following code: "CEO" "Berlin" -intitle:"profiles" -inurl:"dir/ " email:@yahoo.com site:de.linkedin.com/in/ OR site:de.linkedin.com/pub/. This way, you can limit your search results to LinkedIn profiles specific to a certain country and city.
